## Milestone 4 Project
This project is to demonstrate full stack development skills which in this case have enabled the creation of an e-commerce store for dirt bike products such as; clothing, protection, helmets, boots, etc. I have decided to create an online store because I plan on turning it into a real functioning business. Python and Django framework along with HTML and CSS have been used for its creation.

## UX and Design

Wireframing was done through [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/)

#### Target Group
This online shop targets people who are into dirt bikes and who are looking for that type of equipment. The concept is to provide high quality protection products like body armor and helmets as this sport/hobby can be quite dangerous, hence, finest equipment is from paramount importance. Also, the shop enables nice UX with its simplicity and ease of access. Just with a couple of clicks a customer can place his or her order without being re-directed to extra links. An order can be placed even without creating an account which is a feature that I personally find very useful.
